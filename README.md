# algorithms visualization

- visualizes pathfinding algorithms
- very cool
- view GitHub Pages to test it out (https://tarantelfaser.github.io/algorithm-visualization/)
- made with Angular (using Angular Material)

# How to use
- choose an algorithm and run it to see it search from the starting to the ending point
- place walls by clicking on the grid (algorithms have to find a way around them)
- remove walls by clicking on the wall
- after the algorithm has found a path, you can place more walls or move the starting / ending point to see the path change interactively

# Commands
