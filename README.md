# algorithms visualization

- visualizes pathfinding / search algorithms
- very cool
- view GitHub Pages to test it out (https://tarantelfaser.github.io/algorithm-visualization/)
- made with Angular (using Angular Material)

# How to use

- use the buttons in the header to run an algorithm or to edit the grid
- Place a starting point
- Place a ending point
- Place walls (algorithms have to find a way around them)
- Start the algorithm (you can change the animation speed by using the slider)
- after the algorithm has found a path, you can place more walls to see the path change interactively
